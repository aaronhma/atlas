ðŸš€ This is Atlas. Fast. Fuel efficient. The official rocket of Firebolt Space Agency.
We chose to build Atlas not because it is easy, but because it is hard.

## Alert! Please Read!
We, Aaron Ma and Rohan Fernandes are preparing a special holiday release for April Fool's Day 2020. Stay tuned for updates!

FOR ROHAN & AARON:

Please check your assignments and grades in ASSIGNMENTS.md

## Atomic Base Info
**Alert!** Atomic Base is still *unstable*. If Atomic Base crashes, please do not be alarmed. Note that Atomic Base is a side project to simplify Travis CI and building for Atlas and is *not to be used for anything else*.

## Atlas Info
@TODO(aaronhma) : Update


**Rohan; Atlas Info**
```
Atlas is a SpaceShip that travels to the moon. We built it becasue we wanted to help the space industry with its rocket missioin.

Now, I made the HoneyComb and SkyHawk Part. HoneyComb is a Website created

to control parts of the SpaceShip as well as provide entertainment.

SkyHawk is a time management app built using Microsoft Xamarin it uses C# to do the CodeBehind and XAML to show the User Interace.

SkyHawk was built because onboard atlas people don't

have very good time agament as there is not sense of time on the ship.  SkyHawk combines Python, and C# 

to create wonderfule and amazing games and it is built with Java and Swift 

Now Project Omega is about helping with Coronavirus which put the whole earth in a lockdown. As there were not many Tests and people needed help.

Omega helps with Coronavirus Concerns using Python and Machine

Learning as well as C# This application will create a less concern

The Rocket is made by Aaron Ma. He used C++ and Python for Rocket Functionality

## Getting Started Guide

**The Docs: For Testing**

To start: Go to the HoneyComb Folder 
```
Execute Command: python Server.py 
```
This starts the Server

On your command Prompt you will see a url

Go to `127.0.0.1:7777`

**ERROR HANDLING WITH HOSTS**

If it goes to another website, go to HoneyComb's server.py and in app.run change the Port to another number 

To change in do this: `Port = {number}`: where nuumber is the port number you want and then, you can go to `127.0.0.1:{number}`

**Short Cut for LocalHost**

What you can do is copy the link or **Windows**: Alt + Click **Mac** Control + Click **Linux**:

@TODO: Aaron on your linux go to honeycomb and run python server.py then u will see a link to go to. hover over and it will show u the command

@TODO: Rohan make docs for OnBoard, Aaron supply OS for machine running the code

**Website**


**TADA** You will see the website.
