ðŸš€ This is Atlas. Fast. Fuel efficient. The official rocket of Firebolt Space Agency.
We chose to build Atlas not because it is easy, but because it is hard.

## Atlas Info
@TODO(aaronhma) : Update


**Rohan; Atlas Info**
```
Atlas is a SpaceShip that travels to the moon. We built it becasue we wanted to help the space industry with its rocket missioin. Now, I made the HoneyComb and SkyHawk Part. HoneyComb is a Website created

to control parts of the SpaceShip as well as provide entertainment.

SkyHawk is a time management app built using Microsoft Xamarin it uses C# to do the CodeBehind and XAML to show the User Interace. SkyHawk was built because onboard atlas people don't

have very good time agament as there is not sense of time on the ship. SkyHawk helps with Scheduling and is aviable on iOS, Andriod, and UWP ( Universal Windows Platform ). SkyHawk combines Python, and C# 

to create wonderfule and amazing games 

Now Project Omega is about helping with Coronavirus which put the whole earth in a lockdown. As there were not many Tests and people needed help. Omega helps with Coronavirus Concerns using Python and Machine

Learning as well as C# This application will create a less concern

The Rocket is made by Aaron Ma. He used C++ and Python for Rocket Functionality

```
**INFO**

Usually the NUmber will be 5000

**ERROR HANDLING WITH HOSTS**

If it goes to another website, go to HoneyComb's Server.py and in App.run change the Port to another number ( The Number You will see in the Command Prompt ) 
```
To change in do this : **Port = {number}** : where nuumber is the port number you want
```
**Short Cut for LocalHost**
```
What you can do is copy the link or **Windows**: Alt + Click **Mac** Control + Click **Linux**:
```
@TODO: Aaron on your linux go to honeycomb and run python server.py then u will see a link to go to. hover over and it will show u he command
